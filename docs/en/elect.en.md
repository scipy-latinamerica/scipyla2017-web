### Instructions for Authors

SciPyLA 2017 will publish two serialized manuscripts, the first one will be for full peer-reviewed papers, and the second one for poster-abstracts. The submission, review and final publication of both series will be managed through the [online system](http://ojs.pythonpapers.org/).

The conference offers the researchers the opportunity to publish in the international journal __The Python Papers__ (TPP), ISSN: 1834-3147, for full peer-reviewed papers, and in the "The Python Papers Monograph (TPPM)" for poster-abstracts. Both journals are indexed in:
